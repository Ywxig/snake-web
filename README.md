## Sytaxsis and Rule!
> * The basic rule is to take the maximum advantage of all programming languages.
For this reason, the `DRY` design principles, in addition to this principle, I also want to add the possibility of `OOD` and `OOP`.
These concepts are well suited for Designing full polorams, instead of the technical style we will use `OOP`.

## code convention was written;
#### these are standard classes in file <filename.css>

> 1. ` main ` - for the body tag
> 2. ` Heder ` - for headers ( # )
> 3. ` high-light ` - highlighting a section of text ( * )
> 4. ` Italic ` - for italics ( ' )
> 5. ` text ` - to highlight individual details or to create footnotes ( ~ )

# Tables
> Since html has the ability to create tables, it is also possible to create tables in SW, there is a table that has been created and you only need to write the correct operator
or you can write your own table, but there is a limitation in the table, you cannot add more than one cell, only one cell.


> ` tr ` - answers for the table itself, this is tet ` table `

> ` td ` - table rows i.e. ` 1-n ` where ` n ` is the number of rows

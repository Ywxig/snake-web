# Welcom to SnakeWeb


 > * This is my version HTML 

# snake-web

> * `snake-web` is a language for writing web pages and giving the page a special style. It allows you to increase the speed of writing pages.

## Sytaxsis and Rule!
> * The basic rule is to take the maximum advantage of all programming languages.
For this reason, the `DRY` design principles, in addition to this principle, I also want to add the possibility of `OOD` and `OOP`.
These concepts are well suited for Designing full polorams, instead of the technical style we will use `OOP`.

## code convention was written;
#### these are standard classes in file <filename.css>

> 1. ` main ` - for the body tag
> 2. ` Heder ` - for headers ( # )
> 3. ` high-light ` - highlighting a section of text ( * )
> 4. ` Italic ` - for italics ( ' )
> 5. ` text ` - to highlight individual details or to create footnotes ( ~ )

# Tables
> Since html has the ability to create tables, it is also possible to create tables in SW, there is a table that has been created and you only need to write the correct operator
or you can write your own table, but there is a limitation in the table, you cannot add more than one cell, only one cell.


> * ` tr ` - answers for the table itself, this is tet ` table `

> * ` td ` - table rows i.e. ` 1-n ` where ` n ` is the number of rows

# review

> * Algorithm for checking the code for the presence of any word or structure, and subcheck as a percentage of the number of key words in the code

# Zoe in Snake-Web
## Understanding 

> Zoe can understand what you wrote. Uses an algorithm for comparing characters and then checking this number with a number to pass the 55% check

>the Say() method is needed so that she can say a remark from the list
>the Match_word() method is the algorithm for understanding what the user said

## HR
> Zoe will select the appropriate 42 first interviews for you to pass

> And she is also the one who will piss you off, or rather from her person, you will receive tasks for which you need to answer yes or no

> The find() method will find you suitable interviews for the type you specify and your level
